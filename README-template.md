## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid (to center the card with place-items: center)
- Flexbox (to align items inside the card)
- Mobile-first workflow
- Box-shadow hover animation

### What I learned

How to perfectly center a single element using CSS Grid and place-items: center.
Improved my understanding of semantic HTML structure.

```css
.qr-card {
  box-shadow: -5px 5px 20px -5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.129);
  transition: box-shadow 0.35s ease;
}
.qr-card:hover {
  box-shadow: -10px 10px 25px -5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.22); 
}
```

### Continued development
In future projects, I want to continue improving my CSS layout skills, exploring more responsive design techniques, and practicing clean component-based structuring.
